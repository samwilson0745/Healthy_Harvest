    "Description": "Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects the leaves and fruit of apple trees. The disease causes brown or black discoloration and lesions on the leaves, which can lead to defoliation. In severe cases, the fruit may also be affected, resulting in unsightly scabby lesions. The disease is most commonly seen in areas with cool, wet springs.",
    "Cure": "Treatment for apple scab typically involves the use of fungicides. These fungicides can be applied as a preventive measure before the onset of the disease, or as a curative treatment after the disease has been detected. In addition to fungicides, pruning and destroying infected leaves and fruit can also help to control the spread of the disease. Cultural practices such as good sanitation, proper irrigation and fertilization, and selecting disease-resistant cultivars can also be helpful in managing apple scab.",

The rot may then spread throughout the fruit, causing it to become soft and mushy. Back rot is most severe in warm, humid weather and is often associated with insect damage, sunscald, or other fruit injuries.",
    "Cure": "Control of apple back rot begins with good cultural practices. This includes selecting disease-resistant cultivars, proper pruning, and maintaining good sanitation in the orchard. The use of fungicides can also be an effective means of controlling the disease. Applications should be made at regular intervals throughout the growing season, starting at bloom and continuing until harvest. Properly timing fungicide applications is critical to achieving good control of back rot.",

The disease is characterized by a white, powdery growth on the surface of the leaves and fruit. As the disease progresses, leaves may become distorted and may turn yellow or brown. In severe cases, the fruit may be deformed and may not mature properly.",

Properly timing fungicide applications is critical to achieving good control of powdery mildew. In addition, avoiding overhead irrigation and promoting good air circulation within the canopy can also help to reduce powdery mildew development.",

The disease is characterized by large, dark-colored lesions on the leaves, often with a characteristic “frog-eye” pattern. The lesions can start out as small, water-soaked spots, but will eventually expand and become necrotic. In severe cases, the disease can cause significant defoliation and may reduce the yield of the crop.",
    "Cure": "Control of corn northern leaf blight begins with planting disease-resistant cultivars. In addition, crop rotation, proper fertilization and irrigation, and destroying infected plant debris can help to reduce the incidence of the disease. Fungicides can also be used as a preventive measure, however, they are not effective once symptoms have developed. Properly timing fungicide applications is critical to achieving good control of northern leaf blight. Applications should be made before the onset of the disease and continue at regular intervals throughout the growing season.",

This includes the use of pesticides to control the Asian citrus psyllid, the use of disease-tolerant or resistant rootstock, proper tree nutrition and irrigation, and regular monitoring of the tree for symptoms of the disease.

    "FruitName": "Strawberry",
    "Description": "Strawberry Leaf Scorch is a disease caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earliana. This disease affects the leaves of strawberry plants and characterized by small, red-brown, circular spots on the leaves. As the disease progresses, the spots will become more numerous and may eventually cause defoliation. Leaf scorch can also cause a reduction in fruit yield and quality.",
    "Cure": "Control of strawberry leaf scorch begins with planting disease-resistant cultivars. Maintaining good sanitation and removing and destroying infected leaves and debris can help to reduce the incidence of the disease. The use of fungicides, especially those effective against Diplocarpon earliana, should be applied at regular intervals throughout the growing season, starting at early stages of growth and continuing until harvest. Properly timing fungicide applications and avoiding overhead irrigation can also help to reduce leaf scorch development.",

      "Space plants properly: strawberries should be planted 18-24 inches apart in rows that are 3-4 feet apart.",
      "Fertilize properly: strawberries should be fertilized with a balanced fertilizer when the plants are about 6 inches tall."

    "Description": "Tomato Leaf Mold is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Fulvia fulva. This disease affects the leaves of tomato plants and is characterized by small, yellowish-brown spots that appear on the leaves, stems and fruit of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots will enlarge and become covered with a grayish-white mold, which can cause leaf yellowing and defoliation. Fruit may become unmarketable due to the presence of dark, sunken areas on the fruit surface.",
    "Cure": "Control of tomato leaf mold begins with planting disease-resistant cultivars. Maintaining good sanitation, proper fertilization and irrigation, and removing and destroying infected leaves and debris can help to reduce the incidence of the disease. The use of fungicides, especially those effective against Fulvia fulva, should be applied at regular intervals throughout the growing season, starting at early stages of growth and continuing until harvest. Properly timing fungicide applications and promoting good air circulation within the canopy can also help to reduce leaf mold development.",

The disease is characterized by large, irregular, dark-colored lesions on the leaves and stem, that can cause severe defoliation. Lesions may also develop on the fruit, causing them to become unmarketable. The disease is favored by warm and humid weather and is often spread by spores carried by wind and rain.",
    "Cure": "Control of tomato late blight begins with planting disease-free seedlings or seed, and using certified seedlings. In addition, crop rotation, proper fertilization and irrigation, and removing and destroying infected leaves and debris can help to reduce the incidence of the disease. The use of fungicides, especially those effective against Phytophthora infestans, should be applied at regular intervals throughout the growing season, starting at early stages of growth and continuing until harvest. Properly timing fungicide applications is critical to achieving good control of late blight. In addition, avoiding overhead irrigation and promoting good air circulation within the canopy can also help to reduce late blight development.",
